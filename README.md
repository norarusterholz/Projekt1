## Note it - Mimis and Noras first web application

Be it a recipe, a simple to do, something you need to tell a friend or just a note to yourself, you can save it in our application "Note it". Beside the tile and the description you can give your note stars to set the importance and of course a finish date if you have one. We have implemented a sort filter and the possibility to mark notes as finished. And the best of all, you can choose from three fancy designs.

We have to admit, this was a though one. But we build it and we learned a lot.

A special thanks go to Alex who helped us a lot with his explanations.
